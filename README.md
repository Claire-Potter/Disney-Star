### User Stories

- Primary User

1. Loves Disney characters and has her favourites, would like to choose a Disney character to plays as.
2. The quiz will need to cover a range of genres within Disney to engage her.
3. A mixed media quiz to keep her interested - a mixture of written, images and audio.
4. The quiz should provide accurate answers when prompted to ensure she can learn more about Disney while taking it.
5. Any feedback and recommendations would be useful.
6. The questions and answers should be correct - nothing worse than seeing errors in a quiz.
7. Include a score tracker to accuratley track and calculate end score.
8. Fun award for knowledge given at the end of the quiz makes it worth her time.
9. Relevant and vibrant images are a must.
10. Audio tracks to play clearly when prompted.

- Secondary User: Quiz Owner

1. Simple website layout.
2. Aligned to Disney look and feel.
3. Ability to add new questions in a simple way
when required.
4. Ability to set the amount of questions asked.
5. Ability to update images when required.
6. Needs to easily understand at a high level which code does what so comments throughout are important.
7. Aims to keep the user engaged, so a way for the user to redo the quiz is a must, questions should generate randomly to make it a bit harder and more exciting.
8. A simple userguide for the site would be helpful.
9. This would be the minimum viable product for the site owner so the ability to add on and grow from here would be great.
10. A link back to the Disney store to open on a new page, to direct the user to view Disney products, as the site is using the Disney name.


## Strategy

I have taken some time to answer the following high-level strategic questions:

 1. Is the content culturally appropriate? 

	The content needs to be aimed at an English speaking person. Someone who is social media savvy and used to completing online quizzes or playing online games. It is aimed at young adults who enjoy the Disney theme, it can be played by children, however ith adult assistance as some questions are a bit too difficult for kids.

 2. Is the content relevant? 
 

 - All of the content revolves around the Disney theme.
 - Questions based on the Disney franchises the Avengers and Star Wars are also included.
 - Images are of Disney characters or Disneyland theme parks.
 - Appropriate images are shown per question.
 - Images for certificates are themed according to the user's result.
 - All questions are based on Disney and included Disney movies, Disney characters, Disney theme parks, the Avengers and Star Wars.
 - Only where appropriate a small amount of images of non-Disney characters are used to compare films. The correct answer is the Disney film.
 - All audio clips are of Disney characters and are matched as closely as possible to the questions asked. Some questions are not regarding the audio clip, so the clip does not affect the ability to answer.

 3. Can we track and catalogue the content in an intuitive way? 

 - The content needs to be easily accessible. The website should be readable on any device in particular a mobile phone  as many people don't have access to a desktop or a laptop.
 - As a user progresses through the site, they will first be introduced to the theme and then immediately engaged by asking to select their own character. They will then proceed to the quiz site, and asked if they are ready to take the quiz. Once the quiz begins all 25 questions are asked one after another and generated in a random order. The score is clearly tracked at the bottom. After the last question the user is taken to the results page and presented with their result, customised to how they did on the quiz. All content is presented in a logical order making it easy for the user to journey through the site.

 4. Is the technology appropriate?  
	 
	 The site is written in HTML, CSS and Javascript. Majority of the code is completed in Javascript to ensure that the site responds to the user's prompts and allows the user to directly engage. 
The target audience, will be able to access the website across all devices and the screen  would render accordingly.

### High-level Business Goals

 - Create a fun and user friendly website based on the Disney brand.
 - All content to be relevant to the Disney brand.
 - The user needs to be able to interact with the site.
 - To be utilised by young adults for entertainment purposes.

### Value

The value of this quiz lies in it's customisation and the use of the Disney content.
Through allowing a user to customise/choose their own Disney character right at the start of the quiz it is drawing them into the Disney world and allowing them to become a part of it.
Once the quiz begins, familiar and well-loved characters are displayed throughout all of the questions. Not only can the user see their favourite characters but audio clips allow them to hear them too. The user can learn more about Disney and it's various franchises through taking the quiz. The site connects to the user through their love of Disney and their memories of various Disney movies from throughout their lives. The results page once again uses customisation to engage personally with the user and reinforces that they are a part of the Disney family.

### Why is this site so special?


 - The consistency and simplicity of the pages - all linking back to the Disney theme.
 - The flow from one section to another through easy to find site buttons, consistantly styled. 
 - Consistent layout, colours, visual aids and messaging. 
 - The use of Disney characters really engages with a user's inner child and sense of nostalgia.
 - The quiz provides a challenge to the user to be able to improve their knowledge. It also allows the user to take a walk down memory lane as they rememeber their favourite Disney movies.
